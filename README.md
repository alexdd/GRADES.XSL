GRADES.XSL
============

XSL Stylesheet that generates grade tables for the German high school's "Kollegstufe". 
Using [Apache FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) as PDF formatter.

The "Kollegstufe" comprises of the 12th and 13th year of high school. You finish these two years, in which you can choose many subjects yourself (basic and advanced courses), with the a-level/SAT exam.
With this graduation you can proceed to university and choose any studies you like (almost) without any restrictions.

This demo XSLT stylesheet shows some important XSLT and XSL-FO features.

Have fun :-]
